# /id8 Project Rule

When `/id8` is invoked:

1. Follow the installed `/id8` workflow file in `.agent/workflows/id8.md`.
2. Execute one step at a time.
3. Require explicit confirmation before repository creation/push and frontend deploy.
4. Respect `--dry-run` as connectivity checks only, with zero mutating actions.
